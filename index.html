                <p>Linda has a very no-nonsense personality and shares many of her traits in common with Velma, such as skills with computer infiltration and research. She had competed with Velma in the science fair circuit more than once, and lost every
                    time.

                <img src="images/shot.jpeg">
                <p>she is good with computers, a brilliant amateur chemist, and apparently a not-inconsiderable gymnast given her infiltration of Mr.E's Destroide base.</p>
                <p>Originally, she was very competitive with Velma, the two sharing a mutual strong disliking of one another and a rivalry in the science club. This changed, however, when they bonded after both working together for Mr. E and realized how
                    ridiculous their rivalry was. When she got cruelly kicked out, Marcie became sad and lonely, yet was still loyal towards Velma and thought of her as a friend and vice versa.</p>

                <img src="images/velma.jpeg">
                <p>She affectionately refers to Velma as "V" after befriending her, indicating she can be a very loyal person despite her cold personality. It is also implied that she has feelings for Velma as well. After the gang reset history, she was
                    recast as Velma's closest friend (outside of the Mystery Inc. gang) and science partner; who she still affectionately refers to as "V."

                <p>She claimed she was released early from prison because she improved the computer system there to be more harsh towards inmates Marcie is a skinny teen-aged Caucasian female with brown hair, which is usually very messy, in loose oily waves
                    held back with plastic barrettes, and wears red-rimmed, armless glasses with yellow lenses. She originally wore a tan hoodie with a white t-shirt underneath,[7] before changing to a brown wool jacket.[8] She also wears a red skirt,
                    striped socks and matching red shoes.
